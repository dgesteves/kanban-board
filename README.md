# Task Organization Kanban Board

### Objective: Create a web-based Kanban board that allows users to organize their tasks. Users should be able to add tasks, categorize them, and assign due dates. The board should provide a visual representation of tasks in different stages of completion.

## Requirements:

1. Task Management: • Implement a Kanban board with columns representing different stages of task completion (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done are examples, but feel free to be creative). • Allow users to add tasks to the board. Each task should have a title, description, category, and due date. • Provide the ability to edit and delete tasks.
2. Task Categories (optional): • Allow users to categorize tasks into different categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Study, Errands, etc.). • Provide an option to filter tasks based on categories.
3. Due Dates: • Implement a calendar or date picker for setting due dates for tasks. • Highlight overdue tasks for better visibility.
4. Drag-and-Drop: • Implement drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to move tasks between different columns.
5. User Interface: • Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and managing tasks. • Use CSS for styling to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive layout.
6. Personal Touch: • While the core functionality is outlined above, we encourage you to add your own creative flair to the project. Think about how this Kanban board might be used in a context that resonates with you or a broader audience. Hint: Consider the spaces or industries where organization and planning are crucial.
